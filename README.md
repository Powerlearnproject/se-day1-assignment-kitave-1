Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,tools and methods to develop and maintain high quality software systems. It helps in creation of software applications which are used in different sectors to run operations for example healthcare sector

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages eg Fortran
Establishement of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement analysis- helps understand the users needs and the system requirements
Design-creating high quality and detailed designs of the software and user interface
Implementation- writing the code and building a high quality sofware in regards to design specifications
Testing-running tests to make sure the sofware meets the high quality standards and functionality requirements
Deplyoment-releasing the software to users
Maintenance-providing continuous updates of the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Both methodologies are used in undertaking and completing the phases of the software development life cycle. In contrast,waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases which is best used in projects that have well defined requirements and low expected changes while agile is an iterative and incremental method that is focused on flexibility,collaboration and responding to change and is best used in projects with adaptive requirements where flexibility is necessary

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is the one who writes the code and implements software solutions
A quality assuarance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
A project manager oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software suites provides comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing the code for example visual studio
VCS are software tools that track changes made to the source code and coordinating work among team members for example git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements,tight deadlines,insufficient funds. Strategies to overcome such challenges include use of effective communication,agile methodologies and prioritization of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing test the individual components of the software 
Intergration testing tests interaction between different components in the software
System testing tests the whole software system
Acceptance testing tests the sofware against the users requirements to make sure it meets the users needs
The importance of these testings is to ensure the software meets the high quality standards and functionality requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting of statements or question to get the best possible response from AI models. It helps in giving clear,specific and concinse questions so that AI models understand exactly what the user needs

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Give me the history of evolution" can be improved by asking "Give me the histroy of evolution in mankind to present" The improved prompt is more effective as it is specific and clear hence geetting a more detailed response
